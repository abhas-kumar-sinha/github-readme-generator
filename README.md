## README Templates That Actually Help

Gitdocs AI comes with multiple README templates designed for different types of projects. These templates focus on structure, not filler text, making them easy to customize.

Common template sections include:

- Key features
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Configuration details
- Contribution guidelines
- License references

Templates act as a strong starting point while still leaving full control to the developer.

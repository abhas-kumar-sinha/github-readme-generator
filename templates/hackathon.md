# 🚀 Project SuperNova

### *The Social Network for Cats. Finally.*

> 🏆 **Winner** - Best Use of AI, Global Hackathon 2025  
> ⏱️ Built in 24 hours by a team of 4 sleep-deprived developers  
> 🐱 Currently connecting 127 cats across 3 continents

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

### Every cat owner knows this struggle:

- 😿 **Cats are lonely** when their owners are at work
- 📦 **They LOVE cardboard boxes** but have no one to share their finds with
- 🕐 **3 AM zoomies** happen in isolation
- 🐾 **No way to find feline friends** with compatible personalities

**The result?** Unhappy cats, stressed owners, and a lot of knocked-over water glasses.

### The Impact

- 📊 **73% of cat owners** report their cats exhibit signs of loneliness
- 💰 **$2B spent annually** on toys that cats ignore after 5 minutes
- 😢 **Millions of cats** living in single-cat households without companionship

---

## ✨ Meet SuperNova: The Solution

SuperNova is a **mobile-first social platform** that matches cats based on:

🎯 **Personality Compatibility**
- Morning bird vs night owl
- Box enthusiast vs bag lover
- Social butterfly vs independent spirit

🍽️ **Dietary Preferences**
- Favorite treat brands (we all know this matters)
- Wet food vs dry food loyalty
- Tendency to steal human food

🎮 **Activity Levels**
- Zoomie frequency and intensity
- Climbing vs floor-dwelling preference
- Toy sophistication (string vs electronic mice)

💬 **AI-Powered Translation**
- Meow to text using GPT-4
- Purr sentiment analysis
- Hiss detection and conflict resolution

*Swipe right for cats that share your love of 3 AM parkour. Swipe left on dogs (obvious).*

### Live Chat with AI Translation
![Chat Interface](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600/50C878/FFFFFF?text=💬+Meow+Translator)

*"Meow meow meow" → "I found an excellent sunbeam. Come immediately."*

### Activity Tracking

## 🛠 Tech Stack

We went FULL STACK in 24 hours:

### Frontend 🎨
- **React 18** with TypeScript (for that sweet type safety)
- **Vite** (because life's too short for slow builds)
- **Tailwind CSS** (we're not designers, don't judge our gradients)
- **Framer Motion** (animations make everything better)
- **React Query** (data fetching that doesn't make you cry)

### Backend ⚙️
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL database + Auth + Real-time)
  - User profiles (for the humans)
  - Cat profiles (the real users)
  - Matches and messages
  - Real-time chat
- **Edge Functions** (for the AI stuff)

### AI & ML 🤖
- **OpenAI GPT-4** (meow translation and personality analysis)
- **Whisper API** (for purr audio analysis)
- **Stable Diffusion** (generate AI art of cats in boxes)

### Infrastructure 🚀
- **Vercel** (deployment in 30 seconds, we timed it)
- **Cloudinary** (cat photos in the cloud, ironically)
- **Sentry** (because things break at 3 AM during demos)

### Honorable Mentions
- **Copilot** (wrote 40% of this code, we're not ashamed)
- **ChatGPT** (pair programming buddy at 2 AM)
- **Stack Overflow** (saved us countless times)
- **Coffee** (the real MVP ☕)

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### ⚠️ Warning: This is Hackathon Code™

Expect:
- ❌ No tests (who has time for that?)
- ❌ Hardcoded API keys (we'll fix it "later")
- ❌ TODO comments everywhere
- ❌ Variable names like `data2` and `finalFinal`
- ✅ But it WORKS! (mostly)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (anything older and you're on your own)
- A Supabase account (free tier is fine)
- OpenAI API key ($5 credit will last you a while)
- A sense of humor about code quality

### Installation (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone this beautiful mess
git clone https://github.com/yourteam/supernova.git
cd supernova

# 2. Install dependencies (grab a coffee)
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# NOW EDIT .env WITH YOUR KEYS! (don't skip this)
```

### Environment Variables You Need

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Supabase (get from https://supabase.com/dashboard)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# OpenAI (get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Optional but recommended
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn  # Catch those 3 AM bugs
```

### Run It! 🚀

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Should open at http://localhost:5173
# If not, we probably hardcoded localhost:3000 somewhere 🤦‍♂️
```

### Build for Production (if you dare)

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview

# Deploy to Vercel
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

## 🎯 Features Implemented ✅

What we ACTUALLY built in 24 hours:

### Core Features (The Stuff That Works)
- ✅ User authentication (login/signup)
- ✅ Create cat profiles with photos
- ✅ Matching algorithm (50% AI, 50% random, 100% fun)
- ✅ Real-time chat between cat owners
- ✅ Meow translation using GPT-4
- ✅ Photo feed of boxes and cats
- ✅ "Paw" (like) system
- ✅ Push notifications (sort of)

### Stretch Goals (We're Amazed These Work)
- ✅ Activity tracking dashboard
- ✅ Trending boxes map
- ✅ Cat personality quiz
- ✅ Dark mode (because we coded at night)

### Known Issues 🐛
- ⚠️ Chat sometimes shows messages twice (refresh fixes it)
- ⚠️ Meow translation occasionally returns "I am a large language model"
- ⚠️ Profile photos upload slowly (we'll optimize... eventually)
- ⚠️ The app crashes if you name your cat "null" (JavaScript things)
- ⚠️ Mobile layout is "responsive-ish"
- ⚠️ No tests because YOLO

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why These Choices?

**Supabase over custom backend**
- ⚡ Auth, database, and real-time in one package
- 🚀 Zero config, just works™
- 💰 Free tier = perfect for MVP

**React over [insert other framework]**
- 🤷‍♂️ It's what we know
- 📚 Huge ecosystem when you get stuck at 2 AM
- 🔧 Easy to find help on Discord

**OpenAI API over training our own model**
- ⏰ Training takes weeks, we had hours
- 🧠 GPT-4 is honestly scary good at cat analysis
- 💸 Pay-per-use beats AWS bills

**Tailwind over custom CSS**
- 🎨 No time for design systems
- 📱 Responsive by default
- 🚫 Zero naming conflicts

### Data Model (Simplified)

```typescript
// users table
{
  id: uuid,
  email: string,
  name: string,
  created_at: timestamp
}

// cats table  
{
  id: uuid,
  owner_id: uuid,  // FK to users
  name: string,
  photo_url: string,
  personality: json,  // {playful: 8, social: 6, ...}
  favorite_treats: string[],
  zoomie_time: time
}

// matches table
{
  cat_a: uuid,  // FK to cats
  cat_b: uuid,  // FK to cats
  compatibility_score: number,
  matched_at: timestamp
}

// messages table
{
  from_cat: uuid,
  to_cat: uuid,
  message: string,
  translated: boolean,

## 🎉 Final Thoughts

We built this in 24 hours fueled by caffeine, pizza, and the collective stress of 4 developers who should have been sleeping.

Is it perfect? **No.**  
Does it work? **Mostly.**  
Are we proud? **Absolutely.**

If you made it this far in the README, you're either:
1. Actually interested in using this (amazing!)
2. One of the judges (please be kind)
3. Procrastinating on your own hackathon project (we feel you)

Thanks for checking out SuperNova! May your cats find their purrfect matches. 🐱💕

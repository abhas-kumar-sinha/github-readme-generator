# What Is a README?

A README is the main documentation file for a project. On GitHub, the README is usually the first thing users see when they visit a repository.

A good README explains:
- what the project does
- how to install or set it up
- how to use it
- where to find more details

README files are typically written in Markdown and rendered directly on GitHub repository pages.

Because the README acts as the entry point to a project, its structure and clarity directly affect how easily others can understand, use, or contribute to the code.

Tools like README generators exist to reduce the effort required to create a clear and well-structured README without starting from a blank file.

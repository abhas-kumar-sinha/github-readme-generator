# README Templates

README templates provide a structured starting point for documentation. Instead of writing everything from scratch, templates help ensure important sections are not missed.

Gitdocs AI includes multiple README templates designed for different types of projects, such as:

- Minimalist
- Standard Open Source
- Backend API Service
- Data Science / Machine Learning
- Documentation-heavy projects
- Monorepo or workspace-based repositories
- Hackathon or MVP projects

Each template focuses on clarity and practical structure, while remaining fully editable. Templates are meant to reduce repetition, not limit customization.

Using a README template helps keep documentation consistent and easier to maintain over time.

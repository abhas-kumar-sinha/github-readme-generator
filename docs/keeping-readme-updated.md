# Keeping README Files Updated

One of the most common issues with README files is that they become outdated as projects evolve.

Changes in features, setup steps, or usage often aren’t reflected in the documentation, which can confuse users and contributors.

Keeping a README structured and easy to edit makes updates less painful. Tools and templates that emphasize clarity and organization help reduce the friction of maintaining documentation over time.

A README that stays current builds trust and improves the overall quality of a project.

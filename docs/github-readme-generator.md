# GitHub README Generator

A GitHub README generator helps developers create README files more quickly by providing predefined structure, templates, or automation.

Instead of manually deciding which sections to include and how to format them, a README generator offers a ready-to-use layout that can be customized to fit a project.

Common benefits of using a GitHub README generator include:
- faster documentation setup
- consistent structure across projects
- reduced formatting effort
- cleaner Markdown output

# README Generator vs Writing a README Manually

Writing a README manually gives full control but often takes time, especially when deciding structure and formatting.

Using a README generator helps by:
- providing a clear starting structure
- reducing repetitive formatting work
- ensuring common sections are included

Many developers combine both approaches: starting with a generator or template and then editing the README manually to match the project’s needs.

This balance helps keep documentation clear without turning it into a time-consuming task.
